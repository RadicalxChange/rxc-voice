    <h2>More information about the decision making process</h2>
    <p>The RxC Voice procedure includes three democratic steps: 1) voice credit delegation, 2) conversation, and 3) decision.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Delegation from September 12th, 17:00 UTC to September 16th, 17:00 UTC</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Like you, each participant (henceforth called “delegate”) receives 99 voice credits upon initializing the process. You will use these voice credits to vote in the Decision stage--but that comes later on.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>During the Delegation Stage, you have the option to transfer any number of your voice credits to other delegates.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the option to send voice credits by email to someone who is not yet on the delegates’ list.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>There are two crucial “twists” to the Delegation Stage--keep these in mind as you consider your decisions about transferring credits:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>A delegate must have at least 25 voice credits to participate in the subsequent stages of the process, Conversation and Decision. Don't give away too many of your voice credits!</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>A pool of voice credits will match your transfers according to the
                  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/"
                  >Quadratic Funding
                  </a> formula.
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Conversation from September 16th, 17:00 UTC to September 26th, 17:00 UTC</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>The Conversation Stage helps design the final decision ballot.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The delegates will all participate in a
              <a href="https://pol.is/home"
              >Polis conversation.
              </a>
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>This is your opportunity to directly contribute items to the ballot by submitting “comments.” You may also submit comments that express any ideas, feelings, or principles that you feel are relevant to the conversation.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the opportunity to “agree” or “disagree” with other delegates’ comments. This gives us detailed information about where there is consensus and where there is disagreement.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>At the end of the Conversation Stage, we will analyze the results of the conversation and curate the delegates’ suggestions into a coherent list of voting items for the Decision Stage. We will publish a statement explaining how that list reflects the delegates’ contributions in the Conversation Stage.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Decision from September 27th, 17:00 UTC to October 4th, 19:00 UTC</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>In this stage, the delegates express which ballot options they like best using
              <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/"
              >Quadratic Voting
              </a>.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>An essential option on the ballot will be "Ballot Ratification."</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>With this particular ballot item, you can express whether or not you feel that the ballot fairly and accurately represents the delegates’ contributions in the Conversation Stage.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>At the end of the Decision, if the sum of effective votes for the Ballot Ratification option is less than zero, the results of the Decision are nullified and a new ballot must be curated and voted on--so make sure you place a couple of voice credits toward supporting or opposing the Ballot Ratification option, depending on your satisfaction with the ballot curation.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>If the ballot gets approved, we publish the Quadratic Voting results ranking the priorities by the sum of their effective votes.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
